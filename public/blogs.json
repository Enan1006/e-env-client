        "description": "The verdict The all-new Mazda CX-50 is a competent. if uninspiring compact SUV that does most things well, but it doesn't do much to push Mazda’s lineup in a new direction. Versus the competition Given how closely matched the compact SUVs in our latest comparison test were, it would be nice if the CX-50 did more to differentiate itself from its competition — or even its CX-5 stablemate. When Mazda unveiled the 2023 CX-50 in November 2021, it was clearly jumping aboard the off-road-vehicle bandwagon that became increasingly prevalent in the market as the COVID-19 pandemic dragged on and people sought any excuse to get out of the house. Off-road vehicles and trims are apparently the new blacked-out appearance packages."

        "image": "https://i.ibb.co/D7tXwM1/phantom-series-ii-5.jpg",
        "description": "The verdict: The Volvo C40 Recharge is a flawed, style-over-substance crossover “coupe” that, while comfortable, has half-baked tech and requires too many compromises. Versus the competition: The C40 Recharge immediately feels outdated. Competitors offer more range, faster charging and better onboard technology without making you deal with the Volvo’s poor outward visibility and lack of headroom. The 2022 Volvo C40 Recharge is Volvo’s second all-electric SUV, and it’s arriving in showrooms this year. It will join the company’s other fully electric offering, the XC40 Recharge, which is based on the gas-powered XC40. The C40 Recharge is a “coupified” version of that car, with a lower, more rakish roofline meant to appeal to folks looking for a sportier take on a Volvo electric vehicle. It has the same bits under the skin as the XC40 Recharge, and largely the same interior, but unlike the XC40, it only comes in a fully electric version — no gasoline option available. "

        "title": "2022 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 High Country Review: Chevy Completes Its Pickup",
        "image": "https://i.ibb.co/mGM0kGT/2021-09-02-image-4.jpg",
        "description": "The verdict: A stellar new interior adds to the Silverado’s existing outstanding capabilities, comfort and driving dynamics, fixing the one area holding it back from being world-class. Versus the competition: There are no more excuses over at Chevy, with the new Silverado easily on par with the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500 in every aspect and category. When Chevrolet updated its big full-size truck lineup for the 2019 model year, we were about 75% impressed by what was done. The automaker focused its efforts on what customers told them they’d wanted in a revised truck, and it all related to the truck’s “-ilities”: capability, reliability and durability. The result was a new truck that was stronger and more fuel-efficient, had better towing numbers and was packed with new technology that was nothing short of jaw-dropping in some cases. But a big problem was immediately apparent: the redesigned 2019 Ram 1500 pickup, which had an absolutely stunning luxury-car-level interior swathed in rich-feeling materials that were screwed together immaculately. By comparison, the new Silverado’s interior was one area Chevrolet didn’t focus too much on, even removing content like seat belt height adjusters, with the explanation that its customers didn’t say they wanted a super-luxe interior."

        "image": "https://i.ibb.co/hDd9xpX/2023-bentley-continental-gt-s-coupe-3.jpg",
        "description": "The verdict: The 2022 Bronco Raptor delivers on just about every promise Ford made when the off-road SUV debuted, with incredible off-the-lot capabilities that seem up to tackling almost anything owners can throw at it. Versus the competition: The Bronco Raptor has the specs and abilities to match or beat the Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 392 off-road, and it can more than hold its own on-road, too. Ford used to have the high-performance, factory off-road market cornered with the F-150 Raptor, but in the last few years, Stellantis — parent company of Jeep and Ram — has one-upped the Blue Oval with vehicles like the Wrangler Rubicon 392 and Ram 1500 TRX. Both vehicles subscribe to the “put a powerful V-8 in it and it’ll be fine” way of thinking, while Ford has taken a different route with the F-150 Raptor by giving it incredible off-road prowess but dropping its V-8 engine for a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6. Though Ford has ceded the horsepower war for now, the automaker has confirmed that an F-150 Raptor R, powered by a V-8, is on its way."

        "title": "2022 Subaru WRX Review: Party of One",
        "image": "https://i.ibb.co/fXbQgTq/koenigsegg-jesko-2.jpg",
        "description": "The verdict: Starting around $30,000, the manual 2022 Subaru WRX is an inherently fun and unique all-wheel-drive performance car. Versus the competition: Where the WRX lacks some sharpness compared with the competition, it makes up for it with standard all-wheel drive for all-season duty. The previous-generation Subaru WRX was great: a four-door sedan with plentiful grip and an eager driving feel. But it was also an absolute brute of a car, with raw, unpolished driving characteristics that didn’t offer much in the way of everyday comfort. For 2022, the WRX receives a complete overhaul, now riding on Subaru’s Global Platform, which is claimed to improve dynamics and reduce noise, vibration and harshness (NVH). Given NVH is the three-letter acronym most synonymous with Subaru’s sport compact sedan (after WRX, that is), I was eager to drive the latest version to see if it offers a more polished experience."

        "image": "https://i.ibb.co/MsDWb7L/pagani-huayra-bc-roadster-1.jpg",
        "description": "Mid-size sedans are the automotive equivalent of an appliance, often purchased as reliable, predictable (read: boring), point A-to-point B transportation. As consumer appetites for SUVs continue to grow, mid-size sedans have become even less palatable to shoppers — but amid inventory shortages and parts supply issues, these dealership leftovers may look compelling for SUV-intenders who can’t wait for the market to stabilize. Which mid-size sedans warrant a look? The Nissan Altima took the middle slot in Cars.com’s 2018 Mid-Size Sedan Challenge, sandwiched between the winning Honda Accord and losing Toyota Camry. While several updates since then have kept it relevant (some added safety features for 2020 and a new Midnight Edition for 2022), it still trails the better Accord, both of which haven’t changed all that much since our Challenge."
